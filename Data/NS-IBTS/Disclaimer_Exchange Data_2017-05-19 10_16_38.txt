4. PROJECT/DOWNLOAD SPECIFIC INFORMATION

Data from the trawl survey database are freely available for downloading.

Whilst the data have been extensively checked by both the supplying institutes
and ICES there are inherent flaws in gathering the information. 
 For example:

* In spite of the fact that now all bottom trawl surveys are in the same database
   and often at least partially overlap in time period or area covered, there are
   differences between the surveys that do not allow the combination of data from 
   different surveys in one analysis unless this point is specifically addressed. 

* There is no guarantee that the gears deployed adequately sample all species 
   (e.g. catchability of flatfish in beam trawls is markedly higher than that of GOV).
   It should be realized that each survey gear catches a gear-dependent subset 
   of the fish community.

* A common property of all surveys is that over time species determination skills
   improve. As a result, new taxa will emerge in the dataset that were previously 
   reported as part of another closely-related taxon.

* Over time the sampling procedures, gear characteristics, timing of the survey 
   or the area covered may have changed thereby influencing the catches. Expert 
   advice recommendations are given in order to prevent bias in the analyses using
   DATRAS catch data, caused by such factors.

*  Please check on the submission status https://datras.ices.dk/Data_products/Submission_Status.aspx
   before finalizing your report.

*  Data product 'Litter Assessment Output' provides data mapping to Exclusive Economic Zones in the 
   field 'EEZ'. Layer with EEZ boundaries is from the http://www.marineregions.org/, 
   and ICES does not bear any responsibility for EEZ definitions. 
   When using this data product, please include acknowledgement of the EEZ data source as in the section below.  

Thus users are urged to treat the data with caution. If the user has any queries
on the validity of the data or the conclusions to be drawn they should contact 
 either the ICES Secretariat or the Chairs of the relevant Working Group 
 (IBTS, BITS or BEAM)
