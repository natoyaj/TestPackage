\usage{
simALKModel(RFA, species, year, quarter, hh, fitModel, keyIdMeshHaul)
}
\arguments{
\item{RFA}{Roundfish area number.}

\item{species}{The species of interest.}

\item{year}{The year which the ALKs are calculated.}

\item{quarter}{The quarter of the year which the ALKs are calculated.}

\item{data}{The CA needed for calculating the ALKs.}

\item{data_hl}{The HL needed for calculating the ALKs (since there can be trawl hauls without age information).}

\item{dfLength}{The length of the pooled length class. Default is 5, e.g. 5 length classes in each pooled length class.}
}
\value{
Returns a list with simulated model based ALK for each trawl haul
}
