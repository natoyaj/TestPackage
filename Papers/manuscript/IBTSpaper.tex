\title{An analysis of the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey Data}

\maketitle


\begin{abstract}

In this research we present estimation procedures for calculating abundance at age indices, and investigate the sensitivity of these of the resulting estimates with respect to the number of otoliths collected at sea. The procedures presented are applied to the North Sea International Bottom Trawls Survey data for cod (\textit{Gadus morhua}) and saithe (\textit{Pollachius virens}). We demonstrate how much information would be lost if the survey design was defined such that fewer otholits were collected. Age length keys (ALKs) are used to map lengths to age, and we use ALKs with and without the assumption of constant age length structures over relatively large areas. All abundance at age indices are presented with variance estimates. \\
%In this research we present an approach for optimising sampling effort of the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey Data.

\section{Introduction}
Fish stock assessments are used by fishery managers for making management decisions regarding catch quotas. The assessments provide fundamental information about the status of the stock, for instance, whether the stock is increasing and support for increased levels of harvest should be given, or whether the stock is decreasing and stricter control on harvest should be implemented. Associated with the parameters used in fish stock assessment is their uncertainty, which should not be ignored when formulating management policies \citep{ludwig1981measurement, berg2014evaluation}. This uncertainty can arise from many sources including natural variability, estimation procedures and statistical fitting. The North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey (IBTS) data, coordinated by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), provides information on seasonal distribution of stocks and estimates of abundance indices and catch in numbers of fish per age-class without an assessment of the accuracy of these estimates. As stated by \citet{ludwig1981measurement} it is relevant for managers to take into account the uncertainty related to stock size when making management polices. The indices of abundance at age from IBTS  are based on data obtained from a stratified semi-random sampling approach of trawl stations,  and  it is essential to account for the sampling approach so as to produce reliable variance estimates \citep{lehtonen2004practical}. If the sampling approach is ignored, the effect on the variance  of the parameters could be substantial (\olav{This is not necessarily the case when using models to describe the uncertainty. However, we should know how the data was collected such that we do not make stupid models}. \ed{I believe that this statement that is currently written is true whether or not we are using models to describe uncertainty. DATRAS has an approach for estimating uncertainty of parameters but it lacks the potential to account to sampling approach-hierarchical survey design, hence we saw it inflates the uncertainty)}.  In particular, the variance could be greatly inflated  due to the clustering effect, which involves intra-cluster correlation of the variables \citep{aanes2015efficient, lehtonen2004practical}. 

There are two separate stages for generating abundance indices per age from the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey (IBTS) data.  The first consist of calculating indices per \textit{length} class, which are obtained by trawling in a stratified manner, sorting the catch by taxa and take biological measurement of the sorted catch. Then that knowledge is transformed to indices with respect to age. The latter part is achieved with an age-length key (ALK), which is constructed by sampling pairs of otoliths (each fish has a pair of otoliths)  in a stratified procedure from each haul and/or sub-area. To our best knowledge, there has been no research on how much the uncertainty of the abundance indices is related to these two distinct parts. The main contribution of this research is to shed light on how the indices estimates and their associated uncertainty estimates change if less effort was spent on collection of otoliths. We achieve the reduction of otoliths by mimicking a sampling procedure with less effort. We also focus on the spatial distribution of the ALK. \nat{Spatial structures in the ALK have also been investigated in \citet{berg2012spatial} and  \citet{hirst2012bayesian}}.

Currently, abundance indices from IBTS are reported in DATRAS \citep{datras} using an age-length key (ALK) \citep{fridriksson1934calculation} which is assumed to be constant over relatively large areas. In this research we propose two ALKs which accounts for spatial variation: i) a nonparametric  haul based ALK, and ii) a spatial model based ALK. These ALKs are described in Section \ref{sec:methods}. %In section \ref{sec:modelBasedALK} we introduce a spatial model based ALK, and see figure \ref{fig:40cmCod2015} for an illustration of spatial variation in the ALK. 
A spatial model based ALK \citep{berg2012spatial, berg2014evaluation} known as the NS-IBTS Delta-GAM \citep{ICES2016b} is currently being used to calculate standardized age-based survey indices used in assessment for the North Sea stock (haddock and cod). And, as far as we are aware the variance estimates of parameters estimated from NS-IBTS Delta-GAM index  are \textit{only} utilized for assessment of Herring (\textit{Clupea harengus}) in the North Sea.

The spatial ALK model introduced in \citet{berg2012spatial} is similar to the model used in this paper; the main difference is that we include the spatial structure through a spatial random field \citep{lindgren2011explicit} and not through two dimensional splines \citep{wood2017generalized}.

 An  overview of the  North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey is given in Section \ref{overview}. The current estimators for ALK and catch per unit effort (CPUE) used by ICES in their database for trawl surveys (DATRAS) and our proposed ALK estimators are given in Section \ref{sec:methods}. We apply these ALK methods to two case studies in Section  \ref{sec:data}, and a discussion is given in Section \ref{sec:discussion}. The R-code for reproducing the results can be fund at github (\href{https://github.com/natoyaj/TestPackage.git}{https://github.com/natoyaj/TestPackage.git}).
 

\subsection{Overview of the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey}
\label{overview}
\indent The North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey was formed in 1991, to combine the International Young Herring Survey (IYHS) and eight national surveys in the North Sea, Skagerrak and Kattegat areas. These surveys began in the 1960's, and the 1970's and 1980's, respectively. The IYHS was developed with the aim of obtaining annual recruitment indices for the combined North Sea herring (\textit{Clupea harengus}) stock \citep{ICES2012}, but yielded valuable information on other fish species such as cod (\textit{Gadus morhua}) and haddock (\textit{Melanogrammus aeglefinus}).

\indent The North Sea IBTS began with quarterly surveys providing information on seasonal distribution of stocks, which allows changes in fish stock to be monitored and abundance of all fish species to be determined. These quarterly surveys, however became difficult to sustain as countries experienced budget cuts making it impossible to maintain high levels of research vessel effort. As such, in 1997 countries carried out a survey only twice a year; a first quarter survey (January-February) and a third quarter survey (July-September). The target species of IBTS fished from 1991-2018 includes standard pelagic species: Herring (\textit{Clupea harengus}), Sprat (\textit{Sprattus sprattus}) and Mackerel (\textit{Scomber scombrus}); and standard roundfish species: Cod (\textit{Gadus morhua}), Haddock (\textit{Melanogrammus aeglefinus}), Saithe (\textit{Pollachius virens}),  Norway Pout (\textit{Trisopterus esmarkii})  and Whiting (\textit{Merlangius merlangus}). There are also several by-catch species \citep{ICES2006Report}

Research vessels from seven nations in the first quarter (Q1) and six nations in the third quarter (Q3) are used for conducting surveys on all finfish species in the North Sea during January-February and July-August, respectively, between 1997-2018. Table \ref{countries} in Supplementary Materials \ref{secAp:areasfishedappendix} gives details of the research vessels. The sampling frame is defined by the ICES index or roundfish areas (RFA) as shown in Figure \ref{icesroufismap} numbered 1 to 10. These  roundfish areas were substratified into small strata defined by non-overlapping statistical rectangles of roughly $30 \times 30$ nautical miles ($1^{o} \  \mathrm{Longitude} \ \times  \  0.5^{o} \ \mathrm{Latitude}$), and were convenient to use for IBTS as they were already being used for fisheries management purposes. \nat{Most statistical rectangles contain a number of possible trawl hauls or tows that are deemed free of obstructions. These tows, which are referred to as   "safe tows", are taken from national databases of participating countries, DATRAS \citep{datras} or commercial fishing data. While nations are free to choose any position within a statistical rectangle to sample, tows are generally selected based on a semi-random approach from these safe tow locations. However, some nations such as Sweden and England use fixed tows, and in some cases Sweden utilizes a depth-stratified semi-random sampling design of tows \citep{ICES2018}. Sampling may be further stratified, in some statistical rectangles, due to significant changes in seabed depth which may, in turn, cause variations in the fish population. In particular, the North Sea IBTS herring, saithe and sprat data are weighted by depth strata in the statistical rectangle \citep{ICES2013}. It is a requirement that tow locations be at least 10 nautical miles within and between statistical rectangles so as to reduce positive serial correlation, and maximize survey precision \citep{ICES2018}. Also, a target coverage of two tows is required per statistical rectangle\citep{ICES2015}, but in some statistical rectangles in the Eastern English Channel, Southern North Sea and Central North Sea intensified sampling is carried out.}

The recommended standard trawling gear of the North Sea IBTS is the mulitpurpose chalut {\`a} Grande Ouverture Verticale (GOV) trawl \citep{ICES2012}, which has been used on all participating vessels since 1992, while different pelagic and bottom trawls suitable for fishing finfish species were used before 1992. Standardized trawling protocols were adopted with a towing speed of 4 knots but depending on vessel performance, tide and weather conditions the average towing speed can be at minimum 3.5 and maximum 4.5 knots. From 2000-2018 trawling is done during the daylight hours, which are considered 15 minutes before sunrise to 15 minutes  after sunset \citep{ICES2012}. After each trawl the total catch of the different species is weighed on board and biological parameters such as length for all fish species caught are collected. Where the numbers of individuals are too large for all of them  to be measured to obtain the length distribution, a representative subsample of 100 fish is selected. A pair of otoliths are collected on board from a small fraction of all the target species from all RFAs (Figure \ref{icesroufismap}) to retrieve age reading. Table \ref{tab:otolithsTable} in Supplementary Materials \ref{secAp:otolithappendix} gives the minimum sampling levels of otoliths for the target species.

\section{\large METHODS}
\label{sec:methods}
This section gives the estimators of abundance indices. The estimators are haul-duration based and utilizes an ALK approach. We consider the ALK approach used in DATRAS and we propose two ALK estimators. The ALK used in DATRAS assumes constant  age-length structures over large areas.  As differences in age-length structures may exist over large areas, these differences do have the potential to result in a biased ALK \citep{gerritsen2006simple,kimura1977statistical}. To account for the spatial distribution we propose a design-based ALK that is haul dependent (Section \ref{sec:haulestimator}) and a model based ALK  (\ref{sec:spatialModelALK}).

\subsection{Catch per unit effort}
\label{sec:cpueestimators}
In this research, the catch per unit effort (CPUE) is defined as the number of fish of a certain species and age or length which are caught per hour trawl. In this section we define the CPUE mathematically, which explains how the index is calculated. For a given species of interest, let $n_{h,l}$ be the number of fish with length $l$ caught by trawl haul $h$. The CPUE for a given length $l$ by trawl haul $h$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cpueHaul}
\mathrm{CPUE}_{h,l} =\frac{n_{h,l}}{d_h},
\end{equation}
were $d_h$ is the duration of the trawl in hours. The CPUE per age class is further defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cpueALK}
\mathrm{CPUE}_{h,a} =\sum_{l \in {\bf L}}\mathrm{CPUE}_{h, l} \times ALK_{a,l,h},
\end{equation}
where ${\bf L}$ is the set of all length classes and $ALK_{a,l,h}$ is the age length key, which represents the estimated proportion of fish with age $a$ in $l$th length class in haul $h$. The mean CPUE per age in a statistical rectangle $s$ is further defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cpueRec}
\mathrm{mCPUE}_{s,a} =\frac{\sum_{h \in H_{s}} \mathrm{CPUE}_{h,a}}{|H_{s}|}.
\end{equation}
Here $H_{s}$ represents the set of trawl hauls taken in statistical rectangle $s$, and $|H_{s}|$ is the number of hauls taken in the rectangle. The mCPUE in $p$th RFA is further defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cpueRFA}
\mathrm{mCPUE}_{p,a} = \frac{ \sum_{s \in S_{p}} \mathrm{mCPUE}_{s,a}}{|S_{p}|} \omega_s,
\end{equation}
where $S_{p}$ is the set of all statistical rectangles in RFA $p$, $|S_{p}|$ is the number of statistical rectangles in RFA $p$, and $\omega_s$ is a weight factor for each \nat{statistical rectangle \citep{ICES2013}}. For species such as saithe, herring, and sprat the indices at age are calculated using the mean over rectangles, weighted for the percentage of area with water depths between 10m-200m, and for RFAs 8 and 9 water depths between 10m-250m \citep{ICES2013}.

 The mean catch per unit at age in the whole study area is defined as
\begin{equation}
\text{mCPUE}_a= \frac{\sum_{p\in {\bf P}} A_{p}  \mathrm{mCPUE}_{p,a}}{A_{\text{total}}}.
\label{eq:abundanceestimatornorthsea}
\end{equation}
We refer to (\ref{eq:abundanceestimatornorthsea}) as the index of abundance at age, where ${\bf P}$ is the set of RFAs, $A_p$ is the area of RFA $p$, and $A_{\text{total}} = \sum_{p\in {\bf P}} A_{p}$.
%mCPUE_{N,a} 
\subsection{ALK estimators}
\label{sec:alkmethods}
The definition of the CPUE of age includes an ALK, see (\ref{eq:cpueALK}), which we described in this section. Three ALK estimators are included in this research, which are named as follows:  \textit{i}) Area based ALK, \textit{ii}) haul based ALK and \textit{iii}) model based ALK.
\subsubsection{Area based ALK}
\label{sec:datrasalkestimator}

\nat{We refer to the ALK used in DATRAS  as an area based ALK, denoted here as $ALK^{\text{A}}_{a,l,h}$}. The area based ALK is defined as constant within each RFA, and is calculated for each RFA by aggregating the age observation from each RFA. $ALK^{\text{A}}_{a,l,h}$ used in equation (\ref{eq:cpueALK}) is defined as the proportion of observed fish with age $a$ in length class $l$ in the \nat{corresponding RFA}. If there are no observed fish in length class $l$ in the RFA, ages from length classes close to $l$ is used. This is referred to as borrowing of ALKs for imputation of missing values. Note that borrowing of ALKs for imputation is a common practice in analysis of both fishery-independent and fishery-dependent monitoring data \citep[see for example,][]{aanes2015efficient,catchpole2017challenges}. The details of the procedure for borrowing age data from neighbouring length classes are given in Supplementary Materials \ref{secAp:DATRASBorrow} (\ed{Olav please verify that what is written in the appendix is correct)}.  The underlying assumption of this ALK  is that age-length compositions are homogeneous within the RFAs. This is a rather strong assumption, and any violation would have an unknown impact on the estimates of abundance indices. \citet{aanes2015efficient} illustrated that violation of the assumption of constant ALK leads to biased estimates of CPUEs. 

\subsubsection{Haul based ALK}
\label{sec:haulestimator}
We \nat{denote the} haul dependent ALK  by  $ALK^{H}$. The $ALK^{H}_{a,l,h}$  used in equation (\ref{eq:cpueALK}) is defined as the average proportion of observed fish with age $a$ in  length class $l$ in haul $h$. If there are no observed ages of fish in a length class $l$ in the haul, ages from the same length class in the haul close by is used (see Supplementary Materials \ref{secAp:oursBorrow} for the procedure) (\ed{Olav please verify that what is written in the appendix is correct)}. 

\subsubsection{Model based ALK}
\label{sec:spatialModelALK}
In this section we introduce a spatial model based ALK, which we define as $\mathrm{ALK^M}$. Using such a model enables us to obtain smooth structures in the distribution of age given length. It further enables us to utilize spatial latent effects. Spatial model based approach of age-lengths are widely used \citep{berg2012spatial, hirst2012bayesian, rindorf2001analyses}, and are used for stock assessment in the North Sea \citep{berg2014evaluation}.  % kvist2000using olav: double check this when i have access.

Assume a fish can be of age $a = M,...,A$ where $M$ is the youngest age, and $A$ is the oldest age which is typically defined as a "plus group". We assume a multinomial logistic model for the proportion at age. In our application we define two ages as the reference ages, and thereby decrease the number of linear predictors compared to using only one reference age. This reduction of parameters is accomplished by assuming there exists a length $l^*$ for each species, such that all fish longer than $l^*$ are above age $M$, and all fish shorter than $l^*$ are below age $A$. Let $p_a(l,s)$ be the probability of a fish with length $l$ at location ${\bf s}$ to be of age $a$. We assume:
\begin{equation}
p_a(l,s) = \frac{\exp(\mu_a({\bf s},l))}{1+ \sum_{i = M+1}^{A-1} \exp(\mu_i({\bf s},l))} \vspace{ 4mm} \ \ \ \text{for } a =M+1,...,A-1.
\end{equation}
Note that either $p_{A}(l,{\bf s})$ or $p_{M}(l,{\bf s})$ is known to be equal to zero, and the other is selected such that $\sum_a p_a = 1$. We assume
\begin{equation}\label{eq:linearPred}
\mu_a({\bf s},l) = f_a(l) + \gamma_a({\bf s}) \vspace{ 4mm} \ \ \ \text{for } a =M+1,...,A-1.
\end{equation}
Here $ f_a(l)$ is a continuous function of length and $\pmb{\gamma}$ is a mean zero Gaussian spatial random field with Mat\'{e}rn covariance function \citep{stein2012interpolation}. The spline $f_a (l)$ is intended to account for that longer fish are typically older, and the spatial random field, $\pmb{\gamma}$, is intended to account for spatial variation in the ALK. The continuous function $f_a(l)$ in (\ref{eq:linearPred}) is modelled with usage of P-splines \citep{wood2017generalized}, and these spline regression coefficients are included as a mean zero Gaussian random effect. The precision matrix for the spline regression coefficients is constructed such that wiggliness is penalized, see \citet[page 239]{wood2017generalized} for details. The R package mgcv \citep{wood2015package} is used for extracting the precision matrix needed for the spline regression coefficients. The marginal variance of the P-splines regression coefficients, $\sigma_f^2$, is estimated in our inference procedure.

We assume that the spatially Gaussian random field in (\ref{eq:linearPred}), $\pmb{\gamma}$, follows a stationary Mat\'{e}rn covariance structure defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:matern}
 \text{Cov}(\gamma(\mathbf{s}_1),\gamma(\mathbf{s}_2)) = \frac{\sigma^2_{\gamma}}{2^{\nu-1}\Gamma(\nu)}(\kappa||\mathbf{s}_1 -\mathbf{s}_2||)^{\nu}K_{\nu}(\kappa||\mathbf{s}_1-\mathbf{s}_2||),
\end{equation}
where $\sigma^2_{\gamma}$ is the marginal variance of the spatial field; $||\mathbf{s}_1-\mathbf{s}_2||$ is the distance between $\mathbf{s}_1$ and $\mathbf{s}_2$ in kilometres; $\kappa$ is a spatial scale parameter of the spatial field; $\nu$ is a smoothing parameter and $K_{\nu}(\cdot)$ is the modified Bessel function of the second kind with $\nu = 1$.  The spatial field is estimated with the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) procedure described in \citet{lindgren2011explicit}. The main concept behind the SPDE procedure is that the precision matrix of a spatial field with Mat\'{e}rn  covariance function can be approximated by a sparse matrix on a grid covering the area of interest. Such a grid and sparse precision matrix are constructed with use of the R-INLA package \citep{rue2009approximate}. The details regarding the construction of the mesh can be found at github (\href{https://github.com/OlavNikolaiBreivik/IBTSspatialALK}{https://github.com/OlavNikolaiBreivik/IBTSspatialALK}).

The species specific constant $l^*$, which is included to reduce the number of parameters, is selected as the mid point between the shortest fish of age A and the longest fish of age M in the corresponding year and quarter. A sensitivity analysis of this constant were performed by adjusting it up and down 5 cm for cod in year 2018 in Q1. The point estimate of the $\text{mCPUE}_a$ then changed in the forth decimal, which we will consider negligible.

The model based ALK estimate is obtained by maximizing the likelihood. We maximize the likelihood with use of an R-Package {\sffamily TMB} \citep{kristensen2015tmb}, combined with the optimizing function {\sffamily nlminb} in R. In this application {\sffamily TMB} is advantageous as it uses Laplace approximation for the latent fields gaining computational efficiency, it also utilizes sparse structures in the latent fields, and uses automatic derivation. 

\subsection{Uncertainty estimation}
\label{sec:uncertaintyestimation}
In this section we describe how the uncertainty of the CPUE estimates are calculated. We use nonparametric bootstrapping to quantify the uncertainty of the CPUEs. In nonparametric bootstrapping independent samples of lengths and age are drawn with from the original data and approximate $95\%$ confidence intervals are obtained using bias-corrected percentile method  \citep{carpenter2000bootstrap}. Nonparametric resampling allows us to estimate the sampling distribution of the CPUE empirically without making assumptions concerning the data. The bias-corrected method adjusts for the bias and skew of the sampling distribution of the data \citep{puth2015variety, karlsson2009bootstrap}. 

A bootstrap procedure for estimating the uncertainty of CPUEs in the North Sea is suggested in \citet{ICES2006Report}. This bootstrap procedure uses constant ALK and CPUE in the RFAs. Here we provide a modification of the bootstrap procedure proposed by DATRAS (\ed{Olav I think we should say here why the procedure was modified, if it's with regards to implementation etc. Please address this)}. \nat{This procedure, which we refer to as the modified-DATRAS bootstrap procedure is divided into two parts; one part which samples CPUE per length (\ref{eq:cpueHaul}), and another part which samples the ALK used in (\ref{eq:cpueALK}). The modified-DATRAS bootstrap procedure is also based on the assumption of constant ALK and CPUE within RFAs. The assumption of constant ALK and CPUE is likely to be wrong, and would typically cause an overestimation of the uncertainty. \ed{(Perhaps we should say here also what the modified-DATRAS procedure does, for example stratified with respect to rectangle? I am not sure of the difference between the two, but we need to distinguish between DATRAS and the modified-DATRAS procedure)}} 

%The bootstrap procedure has two stages: the first is length distribution bootstrapping, and the second is the ALK, that is, bootstrapping of  age distribution by length class. As too few hauls are available in a statistical rectangle, bootstrapping is done by the RFA within the relevant standard index area, in this case the North sea. Only the hauls within the North Sea for a given species are used in the bootstrapping, and that the North Sea is subdivided by the RFAs to form the strata used in the bootstrapping. RFAs are the strata used for the ALKs, and because of the assumption that the age distribution by length is generally homogeneous within each of these RFAs, the ALK for the entire RFAs is applied. The bootstrap procedures are outlined as follow:

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item ${Length \ distribution \ bootstrapping}$ 
%  \begin{enumerate}
%   \item Sample with replacement the hauls from the relevant RFA 
%    \item Construct the sample population
%       \begin{enumerate}
%         \item Pool hauls by larger areas, i.e., RFA. The pooling strata is the RFA combined with the standard index area, which is the North Sea in this case.
%         \item Bootstrap hauls from this pool and put them back into the sampling areas, i.e., the relevant statistical rectangle 
%        \end{enumerate}
%        \item Since all fish are usually measured, it is not necessary to bootstrap fish lengths
%   \end{enumerate}
%
%\item $ALK; \ Bootstrap \ age \ distribution \ by \ length \ class$
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Assume that the individuals for the ALK are randomly taken from all parts of the area. Assume also that the age distribution of a length class does not differ significantly within the different parts of the sampling area
%\item Use the sampled number of fish per length class as a basis for bootstrapping the ALKs
%\end{enumerate}
%\end{enumerate}

%The DATRAS procedure is divided into two parts; one part which samples CPUE per length (\ref{eq:cpueHaul}), and another part which samples the ALK used in (\ref{eq:cpueALK}).  homogeneous CPUE (\nat{is this CPUE per length or age or both?}) within RFAs \olav{(It assumes constant ALK in the RFA. We have also implemented the procedure from DATRAS for sampling HL-data which assumes constant CPUE in the RFA, but that procedure is not used in the manuscript)}. This assumption is likely to be wrong, and would typically cause an overestimation of the uncertainty.  Therefore, we have included a bootstrap procedure, defined as the stratified bootstrap procedure, which instead assumes constant CPUE (\nat{is this CPUE per length or age or both?}) within each statistical rectangle. 

\subsubsection{Bootstrap procedures}
\label{sec:datrasstratifiedbootstrap}
In this section we describe the two bootstrap procedures used in this research. The two procedures differ by how the ages are sampled. The DATRAS and stratified bootstrap procedure are constructed as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For each statistical rectangle, sample $|H_s|$ hauls with replacement from the corresponding statistical rectangle. If there is only one haul within a statistical rectangle, sample either that haul or the closest haul.
\item Sample age observations from the resampled hauls obtained in step 1. For the DATRAS procedure this is achieved by (a), and for the stratified procedure this is achieved by (b) \ed{(Is (a) for the DATRAS procedure or modified-DATRAS procedure (stratified with respect to rectangle)? If (a) is for DATRAS procedure then perhaps we need a (c) included below for modified-DATRAS procedure also?)} :
\begin{enumerate}
\item For each \textit{RFA} and length group, sample with replacement $n_{l,a,RFA}$ age observations stratified with respect to \textit{RFA} and length group. Here $n_{l,a,RFA}$ is the total number of age observations in length group $l$ in the corresponding RFA. If there is only one observed age from a given length group, i.e. $n_{l,a,RFA} = 1$, we sample either that age or an age in the closest length class with observed ages within the RFA.
\item For each haul and length group, sample without replacement  $n_{l,a,h}$ age observations stratified with respect to haul and length group using a pseudo-population bootstrap procedure \citep{mashreghi2016survey}. Here $n_{l,a,h}$ is the total number of age observations in length group $l$ in the corresponding haul. Ages are sampled with probability  proportional to the number of fish in the corresponding length group and haul. If there is only one observed age within a length group in a haul, that age is sampled. \nat{The pseudo bootstrap procedure is presented in Supplementary Materials \ref{secAp:pseudobootstrap}}. \ed{(please read this appendix and verify that the procedure is correct)}.
\end{enumerate}
\item Calculate the relative abundance at age, $\text{mCPUE}_a$ in (\ref{eq:abundanceestimatornorthsea}), using the sampled data.
\item Repeat 1-3 B times, where B is the number of bootstrap replications.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Reducing the number of otoliths sampled for age determination}
\label{sec:reducingeffort}
We also investigate how relative abundance at age, $\text{mCPUE}_a$, and its uncertainty are affected if the  number of otoliths sampled for age determination is reduced. We sample realisations of data obtained with a sampling procedure with fewer age readings by choosing the number of age observations in length group $l$ in the corresponding haul,  $n_{l,a,h}$ (defined in step 2 (b) in Section \ref{sec:datrasstratifiedbootstrap}) to be equal to a pre-defined number. We choose $n_{l,a,h}$ equal \textit{one} or \textit{two} when sampling the reduced effort. By doing that, the sampled data sets in the bootstrap procedure are possible realisations of data obtained by collecting only \textit{one} pair or \textit{two} pairs of otoliths per length group at sea. We choose the length groups to have width $1 \text{cm},2\text{cm},...\text{ or }5\text{cm}$ as these would do the following: 1) \nat{capture the variability in age-length data}, and 2) determine sufficient sample sizes of age readings required to give information on relative abundance at age in the North Sea.

\section{Case studies}
\label{sec:data}
In this section we apply the methods described in Section \ref{sec:methods} to data for cod and saithe from the International Bottom Trawl Survey for the years 2017-2018, which is obtained from the DATRAS database \citep{datras} (\ed{url  for this reference does not show up in Reference. I've tried all I know to fix it but it has not been fixed}). These years are chosen for two reasons. The first is that in year 2018 new sampling procedures proposed by ICES for the collection of otoliths were introduced in the surveys. For instance, $one$ pair of otoliths per length group is sampled for most target species (see Table \ref{tab:otolithsTable} in Supplementary Materials \ref{secAp:otolithappendix} for the sampling procedures for each target species), and this data is appropriate for the application of our proposed sample procedure of reducing the number of otoliths read for age determination (Section \ref{sec:datrasstratifiedbootstrap}). The second is that IBTS included age 0 in Q3 surveys. Also, for some species such as saithe that occupies the deeper waters in the northern part of the North Sea and in the Skagerrak and Kattegat, along the shelf edge \citep{ICESFishMaps}, the IBTS Q3 data is relevant for analyses compared with data from IBTS Q1 surveys, which do not adequately cover these areas where saithe is distributed \citep{ICESJune2016}; see Figure \ref{icesroufismap}. Furthermore, these years provide extensive sample data for cod and saithe with quarterly sampling effort varying between 345 and 385 trawl hauls. For each of these hauls sampled in the years 2017-2018, concurrent length measurements and otoliths for age determination were obtained from a subsample of cod and saithe. The subsample of otoliths taken for age determination varies between 1456 and 2501 for cod, and between 822 and 2163 for saithe. Table \ref{tab:realdata2017-2018} briefly describes the data for the years 2017-2018.\\

\subsection{Estimated indices of abundance and variability for cod and saithe}
\label{sec:codandsaitheresults}
In this section we apply the three ALK methods given in Section \ref{sec:alkmethods} for estimation of relative abundance at age, and the bias-corrected bootstrap method, given in Section \ref{sec:datrasstratifiedbootstrap} for estimating variability of estimated indices of abundance.   The main assumption of the area based ALK is that the age-length compositions of species over large areas are the same. Figure \ref{fig:proportionSkagerak} illustrates the predicted probability of age of cod given length using the spatial model based ALK  (\ref{eq:linearPred}).  Figure \ref{fig:proportionSkagerak} indicates that the main assumption of the area based ALK of constant age-length compositions over large areas is not valid as the ALK seems to vary within RFA 9 (see Figure \ref{fig:proportionSkagerak}).  This trend can be seen over the years 2017-2018 in the first quarter of the IBTS time series, which also discredits the assumption of constant ALK over large areas in the North sea. Figure \ref{fig:proportionSkagerak1} indicates that age given length of 30 cm or 40 cm long cod varies over large areas in the first quarter of 2018. Figures \ref{fig:proportionSkagerak2} and \ref{fig:proportionSkagerak3} provide more illustrative examples of different length groups in year 2017 Q1, further discrediting the assumption of constant ALK over large areas in the North Sea.

\end{figure}

Figures \ref{BiascorrectedALK} gives estimates of indices of abundance for cod in  2018 Q1 and for saithe in  2017 Q3. Approximate 95\% confidence intervals from the bias-corrected bootstrap method for 1000 bootstrap replicates are estimated from the three ALK methods. 

%The three ALK methods gave similar estimates of indices of abundance at age for both species (\ed{we need to discuss results in the plots}). 
%As regards to which spatial ALK method to adopt, it is difficult to identify a method that gives the best performance over all age groups. While both methods seem to give reasonable estimates, the spatial model based ALK generally gave shorter interval widths for both species (Figure \ref{BiascorrectedALK}). Furthermore, compared with the area based ALK and the haul based ALK, the spatial model based ALK allows smooth functions of the spatial effects predicting numbers-at-age. 
(\ed{Now that we know that DATRAS do provide uncertainty estimates using their bootstrap procedure, we should use their approach here and compare with our stratified method. The explanation below is for old results. This should be undated})
\nat{We also demonstrate the implications of using DATRAS bootstrap procedure for estimating the uncertainty around indices of abundance (see Figure \ref{DatrasStratified} in Supplementary Materials \ref{secAp:resultsdatrasALK}). DATRAS bootstrap procedure ignores the fine-scale stratification in the sampling process, leading to an overestimation of the uncertainty; and ignores the age-length data collected at the haul level, resulting in an underestimation of the uncertainty. Thus, the two steps counteract each other. Compared with the stratified bootstrap procedure, DATRAS bootstrap procedure gives an overestimation of the uncertainty for all age groups of saithe in year 2017 Q3, suggesting that it is highly relevant to account for the variation in the data over large areas.}

In this section we investigate the effect of sampling fewer otoliths on estimated relative abundance at age and its uncertainty using the procedure described in Section \ref{sec:reducingeffort}. We use the haul based ALK but the model based ALK could also be used to estimate the indices of abundance (\ed{ this plot is what Jon Helge expects us to produce. Perhaps you or Edvin can produce more sophisticated plots showing the same thing. If there was a bug in the codes it could explain that issue with age 2 saithe, and perhaps including pseudo would give better estimates. Generally we expect RSE to decline with wider length resolutions but this is clearly not the case for age 2 and 5. A similar plot is required for cod data}).

\section{DISCUSSION}
\label{sec:discussion}

In this research we have determined optimal sampling efforts of otoliths for target species of the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey (IBTS). This was achieved by testing different sampling procedures that mimic the real data collection procedure but with a reduced number of otoliths. The estimated indices of abundance and their estimated uncertainty were investigated to determine if there is any real change in the precision of the estimates. Abundance indices were estimated using age-length keys (ALKs). The database for trawl surveys (DATRAS) manned by ICES includes an ALK that uses the raw proportions of age given length assuming constant age-length compositions over relatively large areas. We have developed two spatial ALK methods  to estimate abundance indices and their variance that accounts for spatial variation in the data: 1) a haul based ALK that produces an ALK for each trawl haul, and which uses the raw proportions of age given length, and 2) a spatial ALK model that uses logits for modelling the age distribution in catch data from the length-stratified  subsamples. Several studies have used spatial ALK modelling for estimating abundance indices of the North Sea stocks used in  assessments \citep{berg2012spatial, berg2014evaluation, gerritsen2006simple}. These studies used continuous ratio logits with General Linear Model (GLM) or General Additive Models (GAMs) to model the spatial effects and found large spatio-temporal variability of the ALK and relative abundance at age. We proposed to use Gaussian Random Field Theory to model the spatial effects as a smooth surface to estimate age-at-length and relative abundance for the IBTS data. The spatial model based ALK and the design based spatial ALK (haul based) gave similar estimates as DATRAS estimator for relative abundance at age but the spatial ALK estimators gained better precision. 



The spatial ALK model based estimator appears to be a useful tool to detect significant differences between ALKs over large areas, although estimation of the uncertainty in the ALK from the joint precision matrix is problematic. Including the uncertainty of the ALK in the model requires an approximation of the joint distribution of the regression coefficient and the spatial effect, but this approximation is only as good as the quality of the data in a given year and quarter. For instance, the approximation of the ALK can predict juvenile ages given longer lengths, which goes against the natural biology. This occurs presumably because the approximation fails to account for the negative correlation structures between ages. So the uncertainty in the relative abundance was, therefore, calculated using bootstrapping as done by \citet{berg2012spatial,berg2014evaluation}. In future, the model might be expanded to include the probability of recording inaccurate age-at-length data, so that uncertainty in the ALK could be estimated using the joint precision matrix. The model might also be expanded to include covariates such as trawl hauls to capture any haul variation, for example a trawl haul may "hit" a school of fish  of a certain age.



Figure \ref{fig:proportionRFA1CodQ1} illustrates the estimated age compositions as a function of length for a given haul in RFA 1. The haul selected is the haul with the most number of observed ages of cod in 2018 Q1. Notice that the the model based ALK is smooth, while the area based ALK and the haul based ALK are not. This is an important advantage of the model based ALK, and it is surprising that it did not result in a larger difference in the estimated index of abundance as shown Figure \ref{percentileBiascorrectedCIcod}. An intuitive reason for this is presumably because there are enough observed ages per length group for the haul based ALK to be representative. But, there are some limitations of the spatial model based ALK. For instance, the uncertainty of relative abundance from the spatial model based ALK is calculated using bootstrapping, as approximation of the joint distribution of the regression coefficient and spatial effect, in some cases, fails to account for the  negative correlations between ages. Also, estimating relative abundance at age and its precision from the spatial ALK model can be computationally intensive.

\section{\large Areas fished by different countries in the North Sea IBTS}
\label{secAp:areasfishedappendix}
Typically, two different countries fish each rectangle so that at least two trawl hauls are made per rectangle, but intensified sampling is carried out in the following areas: at least 3 hauls per rectangle are taken in statistical rectangles  31F1, 31F2, 32F1, 33F4, 34F2, 34F3, 34F4, 35F3, 35F4; while six or more hauls per rectangle are taken in statistical rectangles  30F1, 32F2, 32F3, 33F2, 33F3 (ICES 1999).  The Skagerrak and Kattegat is fished solely by Sweden, who sample more than once in every rectangle while the west of Shetland (in Q1 and Q3) and inshore areas (Q3) is fished solely by Scotland. The edge of the Norwegian Trench is fished solely by Norway, but inshore areas near Denmark is fished by Denmark. The southern North Sea is fished by Denmark, Germany and England. France, typically, is the only country that surveys the western English Channel. Areas are surveyed by a single country because of the large proportion of untrawalable area (and subsequent gear damage issues experienced by other nations)  for efficient logistical purposes.

\section{\large Otolith sampling per fish species}
\label{secAp:otolithappendix}
From 1991-2017, most countries conducted quota sampling of otoliths per length group in a RFA. But from 2013 Norway has been sampling one otolith per length class from each trawl haul (to 0.1$\cm$ below for shellfish, to 0.5$\cm$ below for herring and sprat and to 1$\cm$ below for all other species). From the first quarter in 2018 all countries are required to sample one otolith per length class per trawl haul.  Table \ref{tab:otolithsTable} gives the minimum sampling levels of otoliths for the target species. However, for the smallest size groups, that presumably contain only one age group, the number of otoliths per length class may be reduced, and more otoliths per length are required for the larger length classes.\\ %\\

\section{\large Imputing missing ages}
\label{sec:imputationappendix}
With the current IBTS sampling procedure, \textit{one} age reading is collected from every cm group in every haul for cod and saithe. However, missing ages do occur, and in this section we describe how missing ages are accounted for. Note that missing ages are automatically accounted for with the model based approach. However, for the area based ALK and the haul based ALK, some adhoc procedure needs to be followed when age is missing. We want to highlight that missing ages occur relatively seldom. E.g. in 1st. quarter in year 2018 and with length group width equal 1cm, 0.9\% of the cod miss age with respect to the area based ALK. In the same example, 1.4\% of the cod miss age with respect to the haul based ALK.


\subsection{\normalsize Area based ALK}
\label{secAp:DATRASBorrow}
If there does not exist an age reading of a fish of length $l$ in an RFA,  \citet{ICES2013} propose that the following procedure  for the area based ALK be adopted:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $l$ is between the minumum length and maximum length, the age is set to be equal the ALK to the closest length group with observed ages in the RFA. In cases where there are two equally close length groups with observed ages, the average of those two ALKs is used. 
\item If $l$ is smaller then the smallest measured fish in the RFA, the age is set to the minimum age.
\item If $l$ is larger or equal the maximum length, the age is set to the maximum age.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{\normalsize Haul based ALK}
\label{secAp:oursBorrow}
If there does not exist an age reading of a fish of length $l$ in a haul we propose the following for filling missing age-length keys in the  haul based procedure, in sequential order:
\begin{itemize}
\item If there exist an age reading of that length group closer than 60 nautical mile in the same RFA, the ALK from the closest haul with such an age reading is used.
\item If there exist a fish with length in the interval $l\pm 1cm$ with age information in the same haul, that observed age is used.  
\item If the two first step did not produce an ALK for $l$, there exist little information close in space and length, and the area based ALK is used.
\end{itemize}


\section{Pseudo bootstrap method}
\label{secAp:pseudobootstrap}
Assume each length group has $n_{l}$ sub length groups. Assume further in a given haul and a length group that the vector of number of observed lengths and ages within each sub length group are ${\bf x} = \left(x_{1},...,x_{nl}\right)$ and ${\bf a} = \left(a_{1},...,a_{nl}\right)$.  The pseudo bootstrap procedure is defined as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Sample hauls with replacement
\item For a given length group, do the following for each sub length group, $i$ inside the length group: Define $k$ as the largest value such that $ka_{i} \leq x_{i}$. Sample without replacement $x_{i} - k a_{i}$ observed ages in the given haul and the given sub length group, and denote these samples as $a^{\mathrm{extra}}_{i}$. Define the pseudo population of age observation in sub length group $i$, $a^{(s)*}_{i}$, as the union of $k$ replications of the observed ages in the sub length group and $a^{\mathrm{extra}}_{i}$.

\item Define $a^{*}_{l} = \cup_{i = 1}^{n_{l}} a^{(s)*}_{i} $, where $a^{(s)*}_{i}, \ i \in \left(1,...,n_{l} \right)$, are the pseudo populations obtained in step 2.

\item Sample without replacement $\sum_{i = 1}^{n_{l}} a_{i}$ samples from $a^{*}_{l} $.

\item Repeat steps $2-4$ for each haul and length group.
\item Use the sampled hauls and ages in steps $1-5$ to calculate the mCPUE per age.
\item Repeat steps $1-6$ $B$ times.
\end{enumerate}

\label{secAp:proportionofagegivenlengthManyYears}

Figures \ref{fig:proportionSkagerak1}  \ref{fig:proportionSkagerak2}, and \ref{fig:proportionSkagerak3} show that age-length structure of cod varies over the years of interest: the first quarter (Q1) in years 2017-2018. This indicates that the assumption of constant ALK over large areas proposed in DATRAS is invalid. %The plots in Figure \ref{fig:proportionSkagerakAppendix}, which shows the proportion of age  given different lengths of cod in 2018 Q1 further discredit this assumption  as a fish of length 30 cm can be of age 2 (green triangle \mytriangle[green]) or age 3 (blue circle $\mycirc[blue]$) in the northern North Sea; see Figure \ref{fig:proportionSkagerakAppendix}  (a).

\section{\large Estimates from DATRAS and Stratified bootstrap procedures}
\label{secAp:resultsdatrasALK}
The bootstrap procedure proposed by DATRAS lacks the potential to account for the spatial variation in the data. The DATRAS bootstrap procedure ignores the fine-scale stratification in the sampling process, leading to an overestimation of the uncertainty; and ignores the age-length data collected at the haul level, resulting in an underestimation of the uncertainty. The results (Figure\ref{DatrasStratified}) shows an overestimation of the uncertainty for all age groups, suggesting that it is relevant to account for the fine-scale stratification when resampling the data.
